# -The module operrator divides two numbers and produces the remainder-
(10 % 3) # 1

# -You can embedd nums in variables-

(my_num)

# -You can also make this number variables into strings-

# -You can collect the absolute value of a number-
my_num = -5
(abs(my_num)) # 5

# -You can raise a number to a power-
(pow(3, 2)) # 3^2 = 9

# -You can find the greater or lessor number-
(max(4, 6)) # 6
(min(4, 6)) # 4
